# "Touwa" API
Welcome to the GitHub page of a REST API called Touwa!

## What is "Touwa"?
"Touwa" is an **unofficial** REST API that gets information from a Vietnamese R-18 website called [HentaiVN.tv](https://hentaivn.tv). This API can get some important information from the website without any authorization or anything.

This API is currently in development and incomplete, but I will add more functions if I have time.

## Documentations
The API documentation will be coming soon at [the Wiki page of this repository](https://github.com/LilShieru/Touwa/wiki).

## Demo
You can try the demo version of this API in the Glitch host website:
[https://touwaapi.glitch.me](https://touwaapi.glitch.me)

## Dependencies used
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) version 4.17.1
* [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) version 16.6.0
* [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) version 2.88.2

## How to host your own Touwa API
* Download Node.JS version 12 or later, and clone/download this repository.
* Install the dependencies with the `npm install` command.
* After that, just run it with the `node index.js` command and you're done!
